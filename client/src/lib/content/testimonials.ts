      "It's difficult to summon words that adequately express my gratitude for Clint. He has been exactly what I needed at every turn: at times compassionate, pragmatic, intuitive, encouraging, direct, and always professional. He exudes confidence (and rightly so) without ever bestowing unrealistic expectations. By wholly trusting Clint and following his guidance to the letter, I have been able to enjoy the best possible outcomes throughout the course of my custody case.",

    quote:
      "Last year I was highly emotional and a rather irrational after suddenly being abandoned by my wife and served with a surprise divorce. Being a non-attorney, I was scared and very intimidated by all of it. But, then I met Clint Brown. Clint treated me like a human being from the moment we first spoke, onward. Never once did his professionalism waver, even in spite of me at times. Clint's legal knowledge is supreme, his professionalism is to be admired, and his kindness is unexpectedly authentic. In the end, Clint and his team won my case by a landslide. Look no further. You found him. Best attorney in town.",

    quote:
      "I will never regret hiring Clint as my lawyer. I met him just as I had started to go through a child custody battle, and was horribly worried about being misrepresented or having a lawyer who didn't keep my ideals in mind. Not only was he thorough in his work, but he kept me informed every step of the way and ensured me of my rights as a parent. He made a very difficult time in my life much more easy to cope with.",

  {
    quote:
      "My real estate attorney referred me to Clint Brown for assistance with my child custody issue. Clint began working on my case with the ultimate goal of me getting custody of my son. He always gave me realistic expectations of outcomes in a highly charged emotional process while being sensitive to the financial sacrifice the process can involve. Going through the process my instinct was to push hard and fight aggressively for results, but Clint fought smart. I won custody of my son based on the merits of the case Clint presented.",
