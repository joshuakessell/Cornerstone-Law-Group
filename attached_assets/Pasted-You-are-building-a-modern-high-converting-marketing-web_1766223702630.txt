You are building a modern, high-converting marketing website for a Dallas family law firm.

Goal
- Redesign “Cornerstone Law Group, P.C.” into a site that visually and structurally feels like https://www.prospm.com/ (clean, confident hero, big typography, generous whitespace, image-led alternating sections, clear CTAs), but with family-law content and Cornerstone branding.
- Do NOT copy any copyrighted graphics from Pros PM. Use new placeholder images and a new style system inspired by the layout patterns only.

Tech stack (use exactly this)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Use next/image, next/link
- No external UI library unless absolutely necessary
- SEO-friendly metadata, fast performance, accessible components

Brand + content (use these facts)
Firm name: Cornerstone Law Group, P.C.
Primary positioning tagline: “Family… the Cornerstone of Life”
Primary value prop (paraphrase): constructive solutions that protect and redefine what matters most.

Email: info@cornerstonelawtexas.com
Address: 8140 Walnut Hill Lane #220, Dallas, TX 75231
Hours: Mon–Thu 9:00 AM–5:00 PM; Fri 9:00 AM–3:00 PM; Sat–Sun Closed
Key pages exist today: Our Approach, Our Team, Services, Contact Us, Client Area, Make a Payment (external)
Practice areas to feature (family law focused): Divorce, Child Custody, Modifications/Enforcement, Mediation, Collaborative Law, Premarital/Marital Agreements, Adoption, Wills/Trusts/Estate (secondary)

Information architecture (create these routes)
- / (Home)
- /our-approach
- /our-team
- /services
- /contact
- /client-area (simple CTA page with “Portal coming soon” + button placeholder)
- Include a top-nav external link “Make a Payment” pointing to secure.lawpay.com (open in new tab)

Global layout requirements (match Pros PM patterns)
- Sticky header with logo left, nav links center/right, primary CTA button on desktop
- Mobile menu with slide-down panel
- Large hero headline + subheadline + 2 CTAs (primary “Schedule a Consultation”, secondary “View Services”)
- Alternating content sections (text + image, then image + text) with strong section headers
- Use a consistent container width, big padding, and readable line lengths
- Use a neutral, professional palette suitable for a law firm (define CSS variables / Tailwind theme tokens)
- Use modern serif for headings + clean sans for body (Google fonts via next/font)
- Buttons: rounded, subtle shadow, strong hover/focus states
- Include trust section: “Why Clients Choose Us” with 3–4 cards
- Include “Our Services” section preview on homepage with 6 cards
- Include “Our Approach” section with emphasis on collaborative options (no legal advice)
- Include “Meet the Team” preview section with 3–4 attorney/staff cards (use placeholders; structure should support bios)
- Include final CTA band near footer: “Ready to protect what matters most?” with phone + schedule button
- Footer includes full contact block, hours, quick links, and a small disclaimer line (general info, not legal advice)

Design details to implement
- Create reusable components: Header, MobileMenu, Footer, Button, Section, Card, Testimonial (placeholder), ContactCTA, PageHero
- Use subtle background accents similar to Pros PM (soft gradient or light tinted panels behind sections)
- Use high-quality placeholder imagery (local / family / calm professional vibe) via public domain placeholders or simple gradient blocks; do not hotlink Pros PM assets.
- Add schema.org LocalBusiness / LegalService JSON-LD in the layout or homepage
- Accessibility: keyboard nav, focus rings, aria labels, color contrast, skip-to-content link

Contact page requirements
- Build a clean contact form UI (Name, Email, Phone, Message, Topic dropdown).
- Do not build backend email sending. Instead, validate on client and show success toast “Thanks! We’ll reach out shortly.” and also display phone + email prominently.
- Include embedded map section as a placeholder component (do not require an API key), and show the address text.

Services page requirements
- Hero + intro
- Grid of service cards (Divorce, Custody, Modifications, Mediation, Collaborative Law, Agreements, Adoption, Estate Planning)
- Each card can expand into an anchored section below with short descriptive copy.
- Include a CTA banner mid-page and bottom.

Our Team page requirements
- Grid of people cards with headshot placeholder, name, role, short bio snippet
- Add a modal or dedicated section for expanded bio (simple implementation)
- Must be easy to swap in real photos later.

Our Approach page requirements
- Explain the “Different Approach” idea with 3 pillars: Clarity, Strategy, Support (or similar)
- Include a section focused on Collaborative Law as an option
- Include a CTA band at the end.

Deliverables
- Generate the full Next.js project with all pages.
- Provide clean, commented code.
- Ensure it runs in Replit with “npm install” and “npm run dev”.
- Include a README with: how to run, where to edit content, how to swap images, and a checklist for production (analytics, form handling, privacy policy, accessibility review).

Important constraints
- No plagiarism: do not copy exact wording from Pros PM. Use original copy appropriate for family law.
- Keep everything responsive and polished.
- Prefer static content stored in a single content file (e.g., src/content/site.ts) so the client’s info can be edited easily.

Now build the project.
